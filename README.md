## Udemy - Deployment Of Machine Learning Models

This is a project that creates a Flask API around a Gensim Doc2Vec model used for customer review multilabel classification, deploys it using Docker and Heroku through bitbucket CI/CD pipeline. 

This git repo does not include the training data or the trained Doc2Vec or logistic regression models required to get our predictions since the Doc2Vec models are too large to push to github.
